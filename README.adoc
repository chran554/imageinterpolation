= Image interpolation

This is my own implementation of image interpolation. Used for upscale (and downscale) of images.

I have no initial ambitions to make this the fastest or leanest resource consuming algorithm out there.
This project and implementations are made to explore techniques and algorithms to support texture interpolation in my raytracing endeavours as I can not use traditional algorithms or libraries on my own proprietary internal image format. (Plus I need to account for texture wrap and flipping on tiling textures.)

== Dependencies

Nope. No exotic dependencies to mention.

This library applies to the vanilla images as provided by the standard go library `image`.

== Testing

No extensive mathematical testing nor unit tests has been done.

IMPORTANT: https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG[WYSIWYG] - literally.

== Algorithms

Algorithms are created from scratch based on information found at wikipedia.

(Wikipedia is fantastic source of knowledge, if you use it more than 5 times a year consider what it saves you in time and other expenses for dictionaries, courses, and wasted time searching. https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give[Give them a contribution] to keep it running and open.)

== Results

=== Upscale

These algorithms can be used for upscaling an image.
